  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Refactor our configuration-validation code to work uniformly
      for all of its users, to allow configuration options to be
      validated when spread across multiple objects,
      and to isolate code that is allowed to
      modify configuration objects.
      Closes ticket 31241.
